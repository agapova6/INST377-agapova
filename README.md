Hello! My name is Anastasia Agapova. My web development goals include learning PHP, being able to conceptualize how dynamic web pages are made, learning how to run a web server, and understanding web development as an integral part of web design. I hope that by taking this INST377 class I will be able to design web pages in a way that considers and works with the web development process.

In my free time I enjoy watching movies and knitting winter accessories. Nice to meet you!
