In the file, explain what programs you have installed. You need to describe what OS you're using, what application you installed 
(e.g., WAMP, MAMP), and what versions of MySQL, PHP, and Apache are running in your local PC. 

For my local environment, I will be using the LAMP composition. My computer's operating system is Linux. I have MySQL version 14.14, 
PHP version 7.0.22, and Apache version 2.4.18 running in my local PC.
